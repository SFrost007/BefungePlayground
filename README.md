# Befunge playground

The scripts here are a mix of simple [Befunge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge)
"programs" (generous description) written by myself, and example Befunge code
that I found around the time I was into this (circa 2004).

Apologies to the owners of any of the original code which isn't mine, whose
acknowledgements have been lost to the passage of time :( .
